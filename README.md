# Ø2AI — Phase-0 Raw Logs

This repo contains the **unedited daily logs** from the first 19 DevDays of the Ø2AI project — a public journey from zero-code to shipping AI-powered tools.

These logs are real-time notes written during development. They include:

- Honest accounts of wins, failures, and mindset pivots
- Conversations with GPT/Gemini while building
- Technical breakdowns, emotional notes, and lessons

📁 Logs are stored in `/phase-0/devlogs/`  
Each file = one day (`day-01.txt`, `day-02.txt`, ...)

## 🌱 Why share this?

Ø2AI is about radical transparency:  
> “Show every crucial move — not just polished highlights.”

These raw logs let you trace the real journey:
- Which tools worked (and didn’t)
- What bugs hit
- What it *actually* feels like to learn and build with AI from scratch
